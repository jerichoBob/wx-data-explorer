# wx-data-explorer

a standalone tool that leverages rbcodes and kcwitools to perform analysis on astrophysical phenomena (mainly galxies and galactic clusters), spectral analysis on emitters and absorbers, etc. This uses wxpython as the application framework. I am trying to keep the gui components as isolated from the analysis part of the application so that (if needed) we can swap out the gui framework for something else if needed (maybe even a react frontend :)
